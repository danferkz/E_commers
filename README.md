# Frontend

This directory contains the frontend code for the project. It is built using Vue.js with Vite as the build tool.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The entry point HTML file that serves as the container for the Vue.js application.
- `src/main.js`: The entry point JavaScript file that initializes the Vue.js app and mounts it to the DOM.
- `src/App.vue`: The root component of the Vue.js application. It defines the structure and behavior of the main app.
- `src/components/HelloWorld.vue`: A sample component in Vue.js. It represents a simple "Hello World" component.

## Development Setup

1. Install the dependencies listed in `package.json` by running the following command:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server by running the following command:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the development server and you can access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Build

To build the production-ready assets, run the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This will generate the optimized and minified assets in the `dist` directory.
